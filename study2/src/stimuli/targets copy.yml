# Instructions, we tell people morally good vs. morally bad. We're essentially valence coding these cards.
# Cards that are red and blue, red indicated that person did something bad (counterbalance color)—making sure people understand the manipulation
# Aim for like 50 cards for norming, select stimuli that work


# there are many explanations for bad that are necessary, not always the case for good

# Next week: aim to have all stimuli—say, 50 good, 50 bad—ready for norming
